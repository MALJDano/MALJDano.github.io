# Lynneth Daño's Portfolio README

Hello, I'm Lynneth Daño, and this is the README for my portfolio website.

1. **Accomplished Criteria:**
   - I ensured a responsive navigation bar using CSS media queries and JavaScript for a smooth toggle effect.
   - Section highlighting on scroll was implemented using the Intersection Observer API in JavaScript.
   - CSS Flexbox and Grid layouts were applied for an organized and visually appealing design.
   - External libraries like Font Awesome and Google Fonts were integrated for enhanced styling.

2. **Concepts from Class:**
   - You can spot CSS Flexbox and Grid in action throughout my website, creating a responsive and structured layout.
   - JavaScript event listeners were used for DOMContentLoaded, toggle button functionality, and section intersection observation.
   - Media queries were employed to make the website responsive on various devices.

3. **Inspiration for Design:**
   - My design inspiration revolves around a clean, modern aesthetic. I chose a color palette, fonts, and layout to convey professionalism and creativity.

4. **Content Creation Approach:**
   - I approached content creation with a focus on clarity and conciseness. Each section serves a distinct purpose, providing information about my background, education, projects, and contact details. I organized content hierarchically for easy navigation.

5. **Creativity in the Website:**
   - Creativity shines through the color schemes, iconography, and overall layout. I aimed to represent my personality and skills in a visually engaging manner.

6. **Deployment:**
   - The website is deployed using GitHub Pages. I pushed the code to a remote repository and configured GitHub Pages to host and serve my portfolio.
